# D288 Back-End Programming Project

## Description

This is a project for a Back-End Programming class in which I was provided a completed Angular front-end for a travel agency web application. The code found here comprises the completed back-end, not including the Angular front-end.

## Skills developed

I used Spring Boot and Java for the back-end, connecting the Angular front-end to a MySQL server to store the customer and cart data. This project demonstrates proper mapping of data between the web app and the database, implements various elements of Spring Boot and Java, OOP, use of controllers, and implementation of ERD and UML diagrams.
